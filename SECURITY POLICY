## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

To report an issue you can send me a picture of the problem and I will send you a picture of the community developments 
or email me @josephparente204@gmail.com with exactly what you are doing for a job in this area and I really appreciate you being able to help 

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
